Bunker Game Simulation

This Ruby project simulates players in a bunker scenario, where each player is assigned unique characteristics such as profession, health status, phobia, character traits, and more. The program generates a catastrophe and bunker characteristics and saves the details of each player in individual files.

Features:

Unique Player Characteristics: Each player is assigned unique characteristics from predefined lists, ensuring no duplicates.
Catastrophe and Bunker Characteristics: Randomly generates a catastrophe and corresponding bunker characteristics for the scenario.
JSON Data Loading: Loads characteristics from a JSON file, making it easy to extend and modify the lists.
File Output: Saves each player's characteristics to a text file for easy access and review.
Randomized Health and Orientation: Uses probabilities to assign health conditions and sexual orientations.
